# ScreenToMap
Show your screen on some minecraft maps

Websocket branch is currently reccomended as this one is somehow slower despite being 99x simpler.

This branch ONLY works if the device hosting the server is the same device who's screen you want on the maps. Use websocket or RTMP branch if this is not the case.
